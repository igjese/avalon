debug tab

would it make sense to have "debug" tab? for example, to dump database when I need to show it to you, etc

Yes, a "Debug" tab can be incredibly useful for development and debugging purposes. Some potential features you could include on this tab:

Database Dump: A button that, when clicked, exports the current state of relevant database tables to a text or JSON format. This can help you share the database state or analyze it offline.

Log Viewer: A section that displays logs, warnings, and errors directly in the UI. This can be especially useful for debugging issues that are hard to replicate outside of specific game states.

Resource Modifiers: A set of buttons or sliders that allow you to manually adjust the quantities of resources for testing purposes.

Tick Controls: Buttons that allow you to manually advance, pause, or reset the game's tick cycle. This can help with debugging issues related to timing and resource consumption/production.

Reload Configuration: If you have game settings in external files (like your starting resources dictionary), a button to reload these could be useful.

Show Current Game Variables: A table or list that shows the current state of important variables, like the efficiency of each system, the current tick, etc.

Having a "Debug" tab will make it easier to troubleshoot issues, tune game parameters, and understand the game's internal state. However, you should probably include a way to hide this tab or disable its features in a production/release build.

let's make separate debug page, it should
- freeze the game loop (if it's a separate page, that should be already solved)
- have two tabs "logs" and "data"
- display log on "logs" tab, for which we need to create a log instead of print commands
- dump database as json on-screen into "data" tab 
- data tab should have a button "copy to clipboard"
