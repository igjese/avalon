In Progress
Storage Model: Refining and finalizing how resources are stored and managed in various storage units.
Location Model: Deciding how to model locations such as planets, moons, and star systems, and how to track the ship's current location.

Upcoming Milestones
Logistic Bots: Implementing bots that handle the transferring, stocking, and management of resources.
Celestial Hierarchy: Setting up a model to describe the hierarchy of celestial bodies like stars, planets, moons, etc. This also includes creating basic rules for procedurally generating these celestial bodies.
Admin Panel: Starting with basic features for now like export/import functionality. Incorporate logs that are already in place.
Navigation: Adding a star map and a system map, potentially with some interactive features for route planning or exploration.
