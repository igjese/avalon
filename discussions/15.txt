it seems model is fine then. let's discuss then #10, bots and shuttles
ChatGPT
Certainly, discussing the role of bots and shuttles in the context of resource management can provide valuable insights for the model. Here are some points to consider:

Bots
Capacity: How much of a particular resource can a bot carry? Is this a fixed number, or can it be upgraded?

Transport Time: How long does it take for a bot to move a resource from one point to another? Is it instantaneous, or does it consume game ticks?

Types of Resources: Can bots carry all types of resources, or are they specialized?

Task Assignment: How are bots assigned tasks? Is it automated based on some set of rules, or does the player need to manage this?

Resource Prioritization: When multiple resources need to be moved, how do bots decide what to carry first?

Concurrency: Can multiple bots operate simultaneously? If so, how are conflicts resolved?

Energy/Resources: Do bots themselves require some form of resource to operate (e.g., battery power)?

Shuttles
Capacity: Like bots, how much can a shuttle carry, and can this be upgraded?

Transport Time: Is there a time cost associated with moving resources via shuttle?

Resource Compatibility: Can shuttles carry all types of resources or only specific types?

Manual vs. Automatic: Do shuttles require player input for tasks, or are they automated?

Inter-ship Transfer: Can shuttles move resources between different ships or other locations outside the ship?

Docking Requirements: Do shuttles need specific docking stations? If so, do these stations have any limitations or requirements?

Energy/Resources: Like bots, do shuttles require fuel or some other form of resource?

General
Pathfinding: Both bots and shuttles may need some form of pathfinding logic if resource points are located at various locations throughout the ship.

Failures/Breakdowns: Can bots and shuttles break down? If so, how are they repaired, and what resources are needed for repair?

Upgrades: Can either bots or shuttles be upgraded for better performance?

By addressing these considerations, you'll get a better understanding of how these transport mechanisms integrate with the overall resource management system.

bots:
1. bots can carry fixed amount X, better bots (or upgraded bots)  can carry a little bit more
2. transport takes ticks. within a subsystem, 1 tick. within a system 5 ticks, within a ship 10 ticks (i'm making this up, but this is the simplest way I can think of)
3. bots can carry any "itemized" resource, so basically everything that not air, fluids or electricity - this can be defined by storage types they can carry (only general cargo and special cargo, whereas we also have fluids, special fluids, electricity, air)
4. two ways: A. when components are processed, they request X items, a bot promises Y items and that's their task until done, if more items are needed request is still outstanding for other bots to take on. it might make sense to take requests in random order (or process components in random order). B. is when captain decides to move e..g X stuff to a shuttle, but that should also be a request processed in same way
5. bots are stupid, that's part of design. player needs to work with stupid and predictable parts to achieve something non-stupid. like in factorio. later, we might add priority system like in Settlers or in Rimworld.
6. they operate in ticks, if available they take random request from a list of open requests
7. they require power, but when no power available maybe we don't want them to stop completely but work very slowly, let's say taking 10 ticks for what would take 1 tick - alternative would be for crew to also be able to transport items then, but this sounds easier

and 8.  note that some kind of prioritization will be achieved by assigning bots directly to a system (some bots will be "free roaming" while others assigned to system.. in real life cargo hold would have lot of bots assigned to it probably). when Engineering requests something from Cargo, 
 dedicated Engineering bots take requests first, Cargo bots take requests only when dedicated bots from all departments have picked their tasks. this way they are kind of buffer themselves for peak activities (apart from doing loading/unloading for the ship itself)

Shuttles:
1. it has installed storage units too,  capacity depends on them
2. time is X ticks depending on distance from source to destination
3. depends on installed storage units
4. both, player orders them where to go and what to load/unload, but can dedicate shuttles to just keep shuttling stuff between ship and some mining facility. then shuttle will have some simple wishlist what to load/unload at each side (like e.g. in Space Empires 4 or in Colonization). again, shuttles need to be stupid by design, player is the one that needs to be smart
5. yes, shuttle doesn't care. it has a route (at least 2 locations) and wishlist what to load/unload at each location
6. we will need a system, subsystems and components for that, so player can blueprint better capacity and/or throughput or otherwise customize the ship (or installation) for either mining or cargo  hub or war or whatever
7. shuttles require some kind of fuel. maybe we use the same fuel as the ship for the time being, to keep it simple (fuel cells are just for energy, while for propulsion in addition to energy we'll need also propellant or something)

General:
1. no pathfinding, by design. we stick to office-like UI, so distance is the only consideration for us
2. no failures/breakdowns yet, we might add it later
3. bots can be upgraded (just a "magic" upgrade, increasing speed or capacity or something), while shuttles are whatever is in their blueprint. later on we might decide to have blueprints for bots too, but it's very far away. Not that I think about it, we might simplify shuttles too for  the time being, treat them as some kind of special bots that are extra-ship and can carry fluids too.

Your design approach seems well-thought-out and covers a variety of different use-cases and constraints, while also allowing for potential future expansions. Here are some further thoughts on the points you've mentioned:

Bots
Capacity: The idea of having fixed capacities that can be upgraded sounds reasonable and adds a layer of progression to the game.

Transport Time: Having a time cost in ticks adds an element of planning and urgency, which can make resource management more engaging.

Types of Resources: Limiting bots to only certain types of resources keeps the design simple and purpose-driven.

Task Assignment: Having both automated and manual task assignments can create an interesting balance between player agency and automated efficiency.

Resource Prioritization: Keeping bots 'stupid' as a design choice can make gameplay more challenging and engaging as the player needs to think through logistics.

Concurrency: Randomized request fulfillment keeps the design simple and can add an element of unpredictability that might make the game more engaging.

Energy/Resources: Having bots slow down when resources are low instead of stopping entirely is a good way to maintain game flow.

Bot Assignment: The idea of having system-specific bots could introduce interesting strategic elements into the game.

Shuttles
1-7: Your approach to shuttles seems logical, and your point about them being "dumb by design" aligns well with your overall approach. Treating them similarly to specialized bots can simplify things initially and give you room to expand later on.

General
Pathfinding: Opting out of pathfinding keeps the gameplay focused on broader logistical challenges rather than micromanagement, which seems in line with your design goals.

Failures/Breakdowns: You've wisely deferred this for future consideration, but it could add an extra layer of challenge and unpredictability.

Upgrades: This allows for player progression, which can make the game more engaging over time.

Additional Thoughts
Transition: How will resources transition from being "in transit" to "delivered"? Will they just magically appear in the destination storage, or will there be an animation or other indication?

UI/UX: Will there be a way for players to track where bots/shuttles are and what they're carrying? Some sort of visualization or reporting system could help players make informed decisions.

Load Balancing: For both bots and shuttles, is there a mechanism for efficiently distributing tasks to avoid bottlenecks?

Emergency Situations: Given your bot and shuttle designs, how would the game handle emergency situations where rapid resource movement is necessary?

Overall, you have a solid plan with a focus on keeping things simple while leaving room for future complexity. The key will be in the implementation and how these elements interact with each other in the gameplay loop.

transition: they will magically appear in storage. but on bridge we'll have "ships log" tailing all events happening. if there is not storage available to unload, shuttle will wait and retry, but send an alert (which we'll be also tailing on bridge in separate "alert log")

ui/ux: for bots, no, they are part of "alive ship". for shuttles: office-like ui table will be available (filterable, sortable, etc) with all shuttles with their cargo, source, destination and ETA

load balancing: bots will randomly take requests, that should avoid "undesigned" bottlenecks like one machine always taking all resources while starving another machine. "designed" bottlenecks (when player doesn't manage resources well) are fine. shuttles will need to be assigned tasks (can be automated and/or repeatable) by captain, so shouldn't be  themselves root cause of bottlenecks

emergencies: captain will assign "priority requests" and percent of bots (by default 30%) to work on it. shuttles are assigned to tasks explicitly anyway
ChatGPT
Your additional details on the points I raised fill in the gaps quite well:

Transition and UI/UX:
Having a "ship's log" tailing all events is an excellent way to keep the player informed. This can offer a great deal of immersion without making the game too complex.

Your approach to UI/UX is in line with keeping the game simple yet informative. The office-like UI table for shuttles is a pragmatic solution and could serve as a solid management interface for players.

Load Balancing:
The randomness in bot task selection could serve as a basic load balancing method. However, depending on how "requests" are made or queued, this could potentially lead to some randomness in which systems get priority, which may or may not be desirable.

Shuttles, being manually assigned tasks, would inherently rely on the player's judgment to avoid bottlenecks. It keeps the control in the hands of the players, adding a strategic layer.

Emergencies:
Having a way for the captain to assign "priority requests" is a good approach. This would allow for some level of 'crisis management' without having to rework the entire logistics system.

Specifying a percentage of bots to work on priority tasks adds a layer of strategic planning. Players would have to weigh the benefit of quickly addressing a problem against the cost of potentially slowing down other systems.

Overall, you've addressed the concerns and potential issues quite well. It's evident that you've put considerable thought into how to balance complexity, player agency, and gameplay mechanics. As you mentioned, keeping it simple initially while leaving room for future expansions seems to be a sensible approach.

The next challenge would be to translate this well-planned design into an efficient and engaging implementation. I'm sure there are bound to be a few unexpected issues as you begin to integrate these systems, but having a strong foundational plan will serve you well.

few observations:

we could have several units and several types of units for storage of one resource, i.e. it seems to me that resource can't be linked (in ER terms) to InstalledStorageUnit directly

maybe we put junction table StoredResource in between

what do you think? where do we keep currently_stored then?
ChatGPT
Excellent observation. If a resource can be stored in multiple types of storage units or even multiple instances of the same type, then a direct link between Resource and InstalledStorageUnit would be insufficient. A many-to-many relationship between these entities would provide the flexibility you're looking for.

A junction table, let's call it StoredResource, could be the solution here. This table could contain the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for the stored resource entry.
resource_id: Foreign key to the Resource table.
installed_storage_unit_id: Foreign key to the InstalledStorageUnit table.
currently_stored: Amount of this specific resource currently stored in this specific storage unit.
By doing this, you could have multiple records in StoredResource for each combination of Resource and InstalledStorageUnit. This would allow you to store a resource across different types and instances of storage units.

As for the currently_stored value, keeping it in the StoredResource table would allow you to track how much of each resource is in each specific storage unit. This granularity could be useful for management and optimization.
