we are using django

for styling we are using bootstrap

we minimize interactions (outside request/response), but where needed we use jQuery

controller should hold all logic and flow

view should be stupid, just routing requests and serving responses

model should just be fetching data by django orm

we are using DataTables for jQuery for most of our UI
