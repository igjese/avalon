it seems model is fine then. let's discuss then #10, bots and shuttles
ChatGPT
Certainly, discussing the role of bots and shuttles in the context of resource management can provide valuable insights for the model. Here are some points to consider:

Bots
Capacity: How much of a particular resource can a bot carry? Is this a fixed number, or can it be upgraded?

Transport Time: How long does it take for a bot to move a resource from one point to another? Is it instantaneous, or does it consume game ticks?

Types of Resources: Can bots carry all types of resources, or are they specialized?

Task Assignment: How are bots assigned tasks? Is it automated based on some set of rules, or does the player need to manage this?

Resource Prioritization: When multiple resources need to be moved, how do bots decide what to carry first?

Concurrency: Can multiple bots operate simultaneously? If so, how are conflicts resolved?

Energy/Resources: Do bots themselves require some form of resource to operate (e.g., battery power)?

Shuttles
Capacity: Like bots, how much can a shuttle carry, and can this be upgraded?

Transport Time: Is there a time cost associated with moving resources via shuttle?

Resource Compatibility: Can shuttles carry all types of resources or only specific types?

Manual vs. Automatic: Do shuttles require player input for tasks, or are they automated?

Inter-ship Transfer: Can shuttles move resources between different ships or other locations outside the ship?

Docking Requirements: Do shuttles need specific docking stations? If so, do these stations have any limitations or requirements?

Energy/Resources: Like bots, do shuttles require fuel or some other form of resource?

General
Pathfinding: Both bots and shuttles may need some form of pathfinding logic if resource points are located at various locations throughout the ship.

Failures/Breakdowns: Can bots and shuttles break down? If so, how are they repaired, and what resources are needed for repair?

Upgrades: Can either bots or shuttles be upgraded for better performance?

By addressing these considerations, you'll get a better understanding of how these transport mechanisms integrate with the overall resource management system.




User
bots:
1. bots can carry fixed amount X, better bots (or upgraded bots)  can carry a little bit more
2. transport takes ticks. within a subsystem, 1 tick. within a system 5 ticks, within a ship 10 ticks (i'm making this up, but this is the simplest way I can think of)
3. bots can carry any "itemized" resource, so basically everything that not air, fluids or electricity - this can be defined by storage types they can carry (only general cargo and special cargo, whereas we also have fluids, special fluids, electricity, air)
4. two ways: A. when components are processed, they request X items, a bot promises Y items and that's their task until done, if more items are needed request is still outstanding for other bots to take on. it might make sense to take requests in random order (or process components in random order). B. is when captain decides to move e..g X stuff to a shuttle, but that should also be a request processed in same way
5. bots are stupid, that's part of design. player needs to work with stupid and predictable parts to achieve something non-stupid. like in factorio. later, we might add priority system like in Settlers or in Rimworld.
6. they operate in ticks, if available they take random request from a list of open requests
7. they require power, but when no power available maybe we don't want them to stop completely but work very slowly, let's say taking 10 ticks for what would take 1 tick - alternative would be for crew to also be able to transport items then, but this sounds easier

and 8.  note that some kind of prioritization will be achieved by assigning bots directly to a system (some bots will be "free roaming" while others assigned to system.. in real life cargo hold would have lot of bots assigned to it probably). when Engineering requests something from Cargo, 
 dedicated Engineering bots take requests first, Cargo bots take requests only when dedicated bots from all departments have picked their tasks. this way they are kind of buffer themselves for peak activities (apart from doing loading/unloading for the ship itself)

Shuttles:
1. it has installed storage units too,  capacity depends on them
2. time is X ticks depending on distance from source to destination
3. depends on installed storage units
4. both, player orders them where to go and what to load/unload, but can dedicate shuttles to just keep shuttling stuff between ship and some mining facility. then shuttle will have some simple wishlist what to load/unload at each side (like e.g. in Space Empires 4 or in Colonization). again, shuttles need to be stupid by design, player is the one that needs to be smart
5. yes, shuttle doesn't care. it has a route (at least 2 locations) and wishlist what to load/unload at each location
6. we will need a system, subsystems and components for that, so player can blueprint better capacity and/or throughput or otherwise customize the ship (or installation) for either mining or cargo  hub or war or whatever
7. shuttles require some kind of fuel. maybe we use the same fuel as the ship for the time being, to keep it simple (fuel cells are just for energy, while for propulsion in addition to energy we'll need also propellant or something)

General:
1. no pathfinding, by design. we stick to office-like UI, so distance is the only consideration for us
2. no failures/breakdowns yet, we might add it later
3. bots can be upgraded (just a "magic" upgrade, increasing speed or capacity or something), while shuttles are whatever is in their blueprint. later on we might decide to have blueprints for bots too, but it's very far away. Not that I think about it, we might simplify shuttles too for  the time being, treat them as some kind of special bots that are extra-ship and can carry fluids too.

pls comment
ChatGPT
Your design approach seems well-thought-out and covers a variety of different use-cases and constraints, while also allowing for potential future expansions. Here are some further thoughts on the points you've mentioned:

Bots
Capacity: The idea of having fixed capacities that can be upgraded sounds reasonable and adds a layer of progression to the game.

Transport Time: Having a time cost in ticks adds an element of planning and urgency, which can make resource management more engaging.

Types of Resources: Limiting bots to only certain types of resources keeps the design simple and purpose-driven.

Task Assignment: Having both automated and manual task assignments can create an interesting balance between player agency and automated efficiency.

Resource Prioritization: Keeping bots 'stupid' as a design choice can make gameplay more challenging and engaging as the player needs to think through logistics.

Concurrency: Randomized request fulfillment keeps the design simple and can add an element of unpredictability that might make the game more engaging.

Energy/Resources: Having bots slow down when resources are low instead of stopping entirely is a good way to maintain game flow.

Bot Assignment: The idea of having system-specific bots could introduce interesting strategic elements into the game.

Shuttles
1-7: Your approach to shuttles seems logical, and your point about them being "dumb by design" aligns well with your overall approach. Treating them similarly to specialized bots can simplify things initially and give you room to expand later on.

General
Pathfinding: Opting out of pathfinding keeps the gameplay focused on broader logistical challenges rather than micromanagement, which seems in line with your design goals.

Failures/Breakdowns: You've wisely deferred this for future consideration, but it could add an extra layer of challenge and unpredictability.

Upgrades: This allows for player progression, which can make the game more engaging over time.

Additional Thoughts
Transition: How will resources transition from being "in transit" to "delivered"? Will they just magically appear in the destination storage, or will there be an animation or other indication?

UI/UX: Will there be a way for players to track where bots/shuttles are and what they're carrying? Some sort of visualization or reporting system could help players make informed decisions.

Load Balancing: For both bots and shuttles, is there a mechanism for efficiently distributing tasks to avoid bottlenecks?

Emergency Situations: Given your bot and shuttle designs, how would the game handle emergency situations where rapid resource movement is necessary?

Overall, you have a solid plan with a focus on keeping things simple while leaving room for future complexity. The key will be in the implementation and how these elements interact with each other in the gameplay loop.




User
transition: they will magically appear in storage. but on bridge we'll have "ships log" tailing all events happening. if there is not storage available to unload, shuttle will wait and retry, but send an alert (which we'll be also tailing on bridge in separate "alert log")

ui/ux: for bots, no, they are part of "alive ship". for shuttles: office-like ui table will be available (filterable, sortable, etc) with all shuttles with their cargo, source, destination and ETA

load balancing: bots will randomly take requests, that should avoid "undesigned" bottlenecks like one machine always taking all resources while starving another machine. "designed" bottlenecks (when player doesn't manage resources well) are fine. shuttles will need to be assigned tasks (can be automated and/or repeatable) by captain, so shouldn't be  themselves root cause of bottlenecks

emergencies: captain will assign "priority requests" and percent of bots (by default 30%) to work on it. shuttles are assigned to tasks explicitly anyway
ChatGPT
Your additional details on the points I raised fill in the gaps quite well:

Transition and UI/UX:
Having a "ship's log" tailing all events is an excellent way to keep the player informed. This can offer a great deal of immersion without making the game too complex.

Your approach to UI/UX is in line with keeping the game simple yet informative. The office-like UI table for shuttles is a pragmatic solution and could serve as a solid management interface for players.

Load Balancing:
The randomness in bot task selection could serve as a basic load balancing method. However, depending on how "requests" are made or queued, this could potentially lead to some randomness in which systems get priority, which may or may not be desirable.

Shuttles, being manually assigned tasks, would inherently rely on the player's judgment to avoid bottlenecks. It keeps the control in the hands of the players, adding a strategic layer.

Emergencies:
Having a way for the captain to assign "priority requests" is a good approach. This would allow for some level of 'crisis management' without having to rework the entire logistics system.

Specifying a percentage of bots to work on priority tasks adds a layer of strategic planning. Players would have to weigh the benefit of quickly addressing a problem against the cost of potentially slowing down other systems.

Overall, you've addressed the concerns and potential issues quite well. It's evident that you've put considerable thought into how to balance complexity, player agency, and gameplay mechanics. As you mentioned, keeping it simple initially while leaving room for future expansions seems to be a sensible approach.

The next challenge would be to translate this well-planned design into an efficient and engaging implementation. I'm sure there are bound to be a few unexpected issues as you begin to integrate these systems, but having a strong foundational plan will serve you well.




User
ok, before implementation let's simulate one usecase

let's say we want to initialize the game. we have ship with subsystems that have cargo units. now, how do we initialize each of the resources we have. go step by step, and evaluate new model for each one (but don't put everything on screen, just when it's important)

for this pass, let's try without resource.type (it seems to me we could try using storage_types instead)
ChatGPT
Certainly! Let's walk through an example use case for game initialization, focusing on how the ship's resources are initialized and stored in the various subsystems.

Step 1: Initialize Ship with Subsystems
Create a Ship object in the database.
Add various Subsystems to the ship (Engineering, Life Support, Cargo Holds, etc.)
Add StorageUnits to each Subsystem. These will be things like oxygen tanks in Life Support, cargo bays in Cargo Holds, etc.
Step 2: Initialize Resources
Define a set of available resources in the game. For example: Water, Oxygen, Fuel, Food, etc.
Create Resource objects in the database for each of these resources.
Step 3: Assign Initial Resources to Storage Units
For each Subsystem, assign initial quantities of resources to its StorageUnits.
For example, Life Support might get an initial stock of oxygen and water.
Fuel cells might start with a certain amount of energy.
Cargo Holds might start empty or with some basic supplies like food.
Step 4: Create InstalledStorageUnits
For each StorageUnit in each Subsystem, create InstalledStorageUnits. These are the actual instances of storage that exist in the game world.
For each InstalledStorageUnit, assign a resource and initialize the currently_stored and storage_unit.capacity.
Step 5: Initialize "Ship" Dictionary
Initialize an empty dictionary for the ship, ship = {}.
For each Resource, initialize a dictionary within ship['resources'] to keep track of available and capacity.
Step 6: Populate "Ship" Dictionary
Loop through each InstalledStorageUnit.
Update the available and capacity fields in ship['resources'] based on the currently_stored and storage_unit.capacity of each InstalledStorageUnit.
Step 7: Check and Update Game State
Validate that the initialized state makes sense (e.g., capacities are not exceeded, required resources are available, etc.)
Save this initialized state, so the game can start from this point.
Evaluation Points
At this point, we should check whether ship['resources'] correctly represents the sum of all resources and their capacities across all InstalledStorageUnits.
Check that the available and capacity for each resource type make sense based on the InitializedStorageUnits.
Ensure that each Subsystem has the resources it needs to function for the initial game state (e.g., Life Support has enough oxygen to sustain the crew).
And there you have it: a basic flow for initializing the game state, focusing on how resources are assigned and tracked. Do note that this outline is fairly straightforward and doesn't yet account for many possible complexities or additional features you might add later. It's aimed at providing a solid foundation to build upon. Would this work for you?




User
ok, let's assume we have steps 1 and 2 and start with step 3
- start with actual resources and storage types we have: fluids (Water, WasteWater), air (Air), special fluids (Oxygen, Nitrogen), special cargo (Food), general cargo (Nutrients, FuelCells), energy (Energy)
- all installed storage units are in cargo hold, no cargo units are in other subsystems
ChatGPT
Great! Let's proceed with initializing the game's resources in step 3 and beyond.

Step 3: Assign Initial Resources to Storage Units in Cargo Hold
Initialize InstalledStorageUnits within the Cargo Hold with appropriate resources.

For Fluids:

Create InstalledStorageUnits specifically for Water and Wastewater.
Set initial quantities, such as Water.currently_stored = 1000 liters, Wastewater.currently_stored = 0.
For Air:

Create InstalledStorageUnits specifically for Air.
Set initial quantities, for example Air.currently_stored = 2000 liters.
For Special Fluids:

Create InstalledStorageUnits specifically for Oxygen and Nitrogen.
Initialize them, for example Oxygen.currently_stored = 1000 liters, Nitrogen.currently_stored = 500 liters.
For Special Cargo (Food):

Create InstalledStorageUnits specifically for Food.
Initialize quantities, for example, Food.currently_stored = 100 units.
For General Cargo:

Create InstalledStorageUnits that can hold general cargo like Nutrients and FuelCells.
Initialize them, for example, Nutrients.currently_stored = 200 units, FuelCells.currently_stored = 50 units.
For Energy:

Create InstalledStorageUnits specifically for Energy.
Initialize it, for example, Energy.currently_stored = 10000 kWh.
Step 4: Update Ship Dictionary
Initialize an empty dictionary for the ship, ship = {}.
Initialize a ship['resources'] = {}.
Step 5: Populate Ship Dictionary
Loop through each InstalledStorageUnit in the Cargo Hold.

Update the ship['resources'] dictionary.

For example, if looping through a Water InstalledStorageUnit with currently_stored = 1000, update ship['resources']['Water'] = {'available': 1000, 'capacity': 2000} (assuming the Water InstalledStorageUnit has a capacity = 2000).
Step 6: Validate Game State
Validate that the initialized state makes sense (e.g., capacities are not exceeded, required resources are available, etc.)
Evaluation Points
At this point, we should check whether ship['resources'] correctly represents the sum of all resources and their capacities across all InstalledStorageUnits in the Cargo Hold.
Validate that each type of resource has been accounted for.
This assumes all InstalledStorageUnits are in the Cargo Hold and not in other subsystems, as you specified. This should give a good starting point for the resources on the ship. Does this fit your requirements?




User
now, repeat each step but evaluate the model, i.e. try to achieve above steps with our proposed model, and see for each step whether it breaks something
ChatGPT
Certainly, let's walk through the steps and see how they align with our proposed model.

Step 3: Assign Initial Resources to Storage Units in Cargo Hold
Initialize InstalledStorageUnits within the Cargo Hold with appropriate resources.

Model Evaluation: Our model allows InstalledStorageUnits to be specialized by storage type, like "Fluid", "Special Fluid", "Air", etc. Therefore, we can create InstalledStorageUnits dedicated to each resource type, like Water, Wastewater, Air, etc.
Step 4: Update Ship Dictionary
Initialize an empty dictionary for the ship, ship = {}.

Initialize a ship['resources'] = {}.

Model Evaluation: Our model doesn't necessarily mandate a ship dictionary since the focus is on database tables, but conceptually this step is fine. The ship['resources'] could act as a representation of the state of the installed storage units.
Step 5: Populate Ship Dictionary
Loop through each InstalledStorageUnit in the Cargo Hold.

Update the ship['resources'] dictionary.

Model Evaluation: In our model, InstalledStorageUnits are related to specific storage types, but they are not tied to a specific resource. Therefore, summing up the currently_stored amounts by resource type should be straightforward, though it might require a bit more complex query.
Step 6: Validate Game State
Validate that the initialized state makes sense (e.g., capacities are not exceeded, required resources are available, etc.)

Model Evaluation: This is more of an operational check than a model-specific one. Our model should be able to represent the current and maximum amounts stored in each unit, so this validation step should be feasible.
Evaluation Points After Steps
The ship['resources'] should be an accurate representation of the game state.

Model Evaluation: As InstalledStorageUnits can be created for each type of resource (and storage type), the ship's resources dictionary should be able to summarize these appropriately.
Validate that each type of resource has been accounted for.

Model Evaluation: If each InstalledStorageUnit is tied to a specific resource, then this step should be simple. However, if InstalledStorageUnits can hold more than one resource type (e.g., a "General Cargo" hold), the validation will need to be more complex.
Overall, the model seems robust enough to handle these steps for game initialization. It is flexible in terms of storage types, and it allows the representation of different resources and their quantities. The only point to consider is the representation of currently_stored and max_capacity, especially for "General Cargo" holds, where we need to consider more than one type of resource.




User
ok, now deep dive into step 3.1 "Assign initial resources to storage units in cargo hold" and evaluate model (tables, relationshisp, and what you need to create for each) separately for each resource. pls be verbose 
ChatGPT
Certainly, let's deep dive into each resource type and evaluate the implications of our model.

1. Fluids (Water, Wastewater)
Tables Involved:

InstalledStorageUnit
Resource
Steps for Initialization:

Create an InstalledStorageUnit with a foreign key to storage type "Fluid" in Cargo Hold.
Create a Resource record for Water and another for Wastewater, linking them to this InstalledStorageUnit.
Model Evaluation:

We have a dedicated InstalledStorageUnit for "Fluids", which aligns with the model.
The model can accommodate the storage of Water and Wastewater in the same storage unit, but they're tracked separately as Resources.
2. Air (Air)
Tables Involved:

InstalledStorageUnit
Resource
Steps for Initialization:

Create an InstalledStorageUnit with a foreign key to storage type "Air" in Cargo Hold.
Create a Resource record for Air, linking it to this InstalledStorageUnit.
Model Evaluation:

The InstalledStorageUnit dedicated to "Air" aligns well with the model.
The Resource table can manage the amount of Air present.
3. Special Fluids (Oxygen, Nitrogen)
Tables Involved:

InstalledStorageUnit
Resource
Steps for Initialization:

Create an InstalledStorageUnit with a foreign key to storage type "Special Fluid" in Cargo Hold for each (Oxygen, Nitrogen).
Create Resource records for Oxygen and Nitrogen, each linked to its respective InstalledStorageUnit.
Model Evaluation:

The model allows for specialized storage units for "Special Fluids", so this fits well.
Each specialized storage unit can hold only one type of resource, which also aligns with the model.
4. Special Cargo (Food)
Tables Involved:

InstalledStorageUnit
Resource
Steps for Initialization:

Create an InstalledStorageUnit with a foreign key to storage type "Special Cargo" in Cargo Hold.
Create a Resource record for Food and link it to this InstalledStorageUnit.
Model Evaluation:

A dedicated InstalledStorageUnit for "Special Cargo" like Food aligns with the model.
Since Food is a special cargo, it gets its own InstalledStorageUnit.
5. General Cargo (Nutrients, FuelCells)
Tables Involved:

InstalledStorageUnit
Resource
Steps for Initialization:

Create an InstalledStorageUnit with a foreign key to storage type "General Cargo" in Cargo Hold.
Create Resource records for Nutrients and FuelCells and link them to this InstalledStorageUnit.
Model Evaluation:

A general InstalledStorageUnit can accommodate different types of cargo, so this fits well.
The Resources table will keep track of individual amounts of Nutrients and FuelCells.
6. Energy (Energy)
Tables Involved:

InstalledStorageUnit
Resource
Steps for Initialization:

Create an InstalledStorageUnit with a foreign key to storage type "Energy" in Cargo Hold.
Create a Resource record for Energy and link it to this InstalledStorageUnit.
Model Evaluation:

InstalledStorageUnit dedicated to "Energy" aligns well with the model.
The Resource table can manage the amount of Energy present.
From this deep dive, it appears that the model we have is fairly robust and capable of handling various types of resources and their storage units. Specialized units can hold only one type of resource, and general units can hold multiple types, which seems to cover all our bases.




User
few observations:

we could have several units and several types of units for storage of one resource, i.e. it seems to me that resource can't be linked (in ER terms) to InstalledStorageUnit directly

maybe we put junction table StoredResource in between

what do you think? where do we keep currently_stored then?
ChatGPT
Excellent observation. If a resource can be stored in multiple types of storage units or even multiple instances of the same type, then a direct link between Resource and InstalledStorageUnit would be insufficient. A many-to-many relationship between these entities would provide the flexibility you're looking for.

A junction table, let's call it StoredResource, could be the solution here. This table could contain the following columns:

id: Unique identifier for the stored resource entry.
resource_id: Foreign key to the Resource table.
installed_storage_unit_id: Foreign key to the InstalledStorageUnit table.
currently_stored: Amount of this specific resource currently stored in this specific storage unit.
By doing this, you could have multiple records in StoredResource for each combination of Resource and InstalledStorageUnit. This would allow you to store a resource across different types and instances of storage units.

As for the currently_stored value, keeping it in the StoredResource table would allow you to track how much of each resource is in each specific storage unit. This granularity could be useful for management and optimization.

Here's a rough outline:

Tables:

Resource

id: Unique identifier
name: Name of the resource (e.g., Water, Food)
storage_type_id: Type of storage needed (e.g., Fluid, Air, Special Fluid)
... other attributes ...
InstalledStorageUnit

id: Unique identifier
storage_type_id: Type of storage (e.g., Fluid, Air)
location_id: Location where the storage unit is installed
... other attributes ...
StoredResource (Junction Table)

id: Unique identifier
resource_id: Foreign key to Resource
installed_storage_unit_id: Foreign key to InstalledStorageUnit
currently_stored: Amount currently stored
Would this design adequately address the issues you've raised?




User
it seems it could

now pls repeat steps for initialization but only for Nutrients and FuelCells (both are general cargo), but this type assume we have two locations (ship and mining facility), both with their own subsystems (and installed cargo units link to subsystems, not locations directly)
ChatGPT
Certainly. Let's initialize Nutrients and FuelCells for a ship and a mining facility, both having their own subsystems. We'll assume that the cargo holds for both locations have been set up and have InstalledStorageUnits suitable for storing general cargo.

Initialization Steps
Database Schema Set-up

Make sure the tables Resource, InstalledStorageUnit, Subsystem, Location, and StoredResource are set up as discussed.

Initialize Locations and Subsystems

Create a record in the Location table for the ship.

Create a record in the Location table for the mining facility.

Create a Subsystem record linking to the ship, perhaps named "Ship Cargo Hold."

Create another Subsystem record linking to the mining facility, perhaps named "Mining Facility Cargo Hold."

Assign Installed Storage Units to Subsystems

Create an InstalledStorageUnit record with storage_type_id set to 'General Cargo'. Link it to the "Ship Cargo Hold" subsystem.
Create another InstalledStorageUnit record with storage_type_id set to 'General Cargo'. Link it to the "Mining Facility Cargo Hold" subsystem.
Initialize Resources

Create a Resource record for Nutrients with storage_type_id set to 'General Cargo'.
Create another Resource record for FuelCells with storage_type_id set to 'General Cargo'.
Assign Initial Resources to Storage Units

Create a StoredResource record:

resource_id linking to Nutrients
installed_storage_unit_id linking to the InstalledStorageUnit in the "Ship Cargo Hold"
currently_stored set to initial quantity (e.g., 100 units)
Create another StoredResource record:

resource_id linking to FuelCells
installed_storage_unit_id linking to the InstalledStorageUnit in the "Ship Cargo Hold"
currently_stored set to initial quantity (e.g., 200 units)
Repeat these steps for the mining facility's InstalledStorageUnit, setting initial quantities as needed.

Verify Initialization

Query the database to ensure that all records have been created correctly and that the relationships between them are as expected.

Would these steps cover the initialization process for both Nutrients and FuelCells in the ship and the mining facility?




User
sounds good



Your Django model definitions look pretty solid and well-structured. However, I do have some suggestions:

Documentation: Add comments to your models to explain what they represent, especially for fields that aren't self-explanatory. This will be helpful for future development and debugging.

Naming Conventions: Your table names are singular which is fine, but it’s important to be consistent. Make sure to use the same naming conventions throughout the code.

JSONField: For the consumes and produces fields, you're using a JSONField. While this is not wrong, consider using a many-to-many relationship with a through-table. This would allow you to enforce data integrity more easily.

Optional Fields: In the InstalledStorageUnit model, you've set the resource and subsystem fields as optional (null=True, blank=True). While it's okay to have an empty storage unit, it seems like a storage unit should always belong to a subsystem. Consider if this really should be optional.

Normalization: The quantity field appears both in InstalledComponent and InstalledStorageUnit. If this is meant to represent the number of such units installed, you might want to clarify it with comments or consider a name that better encapsulates its purpose (like num_installed).

Data Integrity: Consider adding more constraints, such as unique=True or unique_together, to enforce data integrity.

Additional Fields: You might need additional fields for features you haven't yet considered, like statuses for components and storage units (active, damaged, etc.).

Here is your code with some of these modifications:




User
what I meant is propose ONLY changes that will upgrade old model to the new one needed for storage management we just discussed
ChatGPT
Certainly! Based on our storage management discussion, you'd need to implement changes to handle the relationship between resources and storage units more dynamically, and possibly address multiple locations. Here's how you can modify your existing Django model to accommodate those changes:

StoredResource Junction Table: Create a new model called StoredResource to act as a junction table between InstalledStorageUnit and Resource. This would also include the currently_stored field to specify how much of each resource is currently stored in each storage unit.

Subsystem Location: Since storage units are now related to subsystems and subsystems belong to locations (like a ship or a mining facility), you might need to add a foreign key in Subsystem to reference a Location.
