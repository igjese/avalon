each sensor could output N random locations per minute, we could have different types of sensors (for astro bodies, for resources)

That's an interesting approach that could add a layer of realism and complexity to the game. Different types of sensors could have various attributes such as range, accuracy, and types of objects they can detect.

Sensor Types:
Astro-Body Sensor: Detects planets, moons, asteroids, and other celestial bodies. Useful for navigation and general awareness.
Resource Sensor: Specifically designed to locate valuable minerals, elements, or other types of resources.
Life Form Sensor: For later iterations where you might include alien life or other ships, this sensor could detect biological entities.
Hazard Sensor: Detects environmental dangers like radiation zones, black holes, or solar flares.
Sensor Attributes:
Range: How far the sensor can scan.
Accuracy: The likelihood that the data provided is correct. Lower-tier sensors might sometimes provide false positives or negatives.
Speed: How quickly it generates new scans.
Power Consumption: Higher-tier sensors might consume more power.
Player Decisions:
Sensor Management: Deciding which sensors to run, taking into account their power consumption and what the current priorities are (exploring, resource gathering, etc.).
Data Interpretation: The sensors might not provide all the information, requiring the player to make some educated guesses or take risks.
Upgrade Planning: Determining when to invest in better sensors as the challenges in the game scale.
By allowing the sensors to output random locations, you keep the gameplay dynamic and unpredictable. The player would need to strategize about when and where to deploy sensors, how to allocate power to them, and how to act on the data they provide. It all ties back nicely to the resource management and logistical challenges of the game.

and there could be chain also: each type of sensor provides sensor data, while computers run analysis and produce results (later on possible upgrades are faster computers, or more efficient alghorythms)

even later on we could switch from planet/resource sensors to spectral, radio, gravitic, etc to combine them for different purposes
ChatGPT
That's a fantastic way to add depth to the gameplay, creating a chain of actions that range from raw data gathering to high-level analysis. It not only enhances realism but also introduces additional challenges and opportunities for strategy.

Sensor-to-Analysis Chain:
Raw Sensor Data: Collected by various sensors based on their type and capabilities.
Basic Analysis: Run by the ship's basic computing facilities. Transforms raw data into something more meaningful but still general.
Advanced Analysis: Requires more specialized computing capabilities or algorithms. Can refine data into specific actionable intelligence.
Result Interpretation: The player interprets the analyzed data to make informed decisions. Depending on the game's mechanics, some results might require player interpretation, adding another layer of skill and engagement.
Upgrades:
Sensors: Better range, accuracy, speed, and lower power consumption.
Computing Hardware: Faster processing speeds to reduce analysis time.
Software/Algorithms: More efficient or specialized algorithms that can reveal more information or require less computing power.
Data Storage: Increased storage capabilities to keep more sensor data and analysis results, which might become relevant later in the game.
Advanced Sensor Types:
Spectral Sensors: Used for identifying chemical compositions, temperatures, etc.
Radio Sensors: Detect radio waves and other electromagnetic emissions.
Gravitic Sensors: Measure variations in gravitational fields, useful for detecting hidden or cloaked objects.
Thermal Sensors: For measuring heat signatures, useful in various scenarios from detecting lifeforms to measuring the viability of a planet for colonization.
This sensor-to-analysis chain could tie in well with the existing systems of logistics, resource management, and manufacturing. For example, more advanced sensors and computers might require rare materials to build, pushing the player to prioritize certain types of resource gathering. The player would need to balance immediate needs (like resource gathering for survival) with longer-term goals (like advanced research for improved capabilities).
