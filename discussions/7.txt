# 6. more resources and components

alerts should probably be on the summary ("bridge") tab, which we don't have yet. but since there are no meaningful alerts yet (there is no consequences if e..g oxygen drops to 0, btw it can go below 0 for that matter at the moment) we can do it later.

on historical data, we'll probably want history of alerts but also "game time" of some kind, e.g. one tick is 10 seconds but it could represent 10 minutes of game-time. But this is also for some later iteration

system failures - also for later, since we don't have basic mechanics yet

save/load - good idea, also later but soon

now, that reminds me that we need rough near-term roadmap, to be able to prioritize (like I did above)

let's do the roadmap thing first, not complete but just several steps ahead

since our focus is resource mgmt and logistics, steps for those should probably be first on the path 

we have resources already, with their consumers and producers. we could add few more just to get better feel for the mechanics: plants, vats, water recyclers, oxygen generators

consumption/production could be spanning multiple ticks, but probably not crucial for prototype 0.1 (we'll probably have 100 more builds before anything remotely playable)

logistics we don't have yet, we could add logistics bots to feed the machines from cargo

could you take the above and run with it, pls :)

ChatGPT
Certainly! It sounds like you've got a solid understanding of what the near-term focus should be. Based on your insights and the current focus on resource management and logistics, here's a rough near-term roadmap:

Near-Term Roadmap

This roadmap focuses primarily on the resource management and logistics aspects for now, as you suggested. How does this look to you? Would you like to adjust or add anything?




User
each of these could be discussed for hours, but let's focus on #1 - what new systems, subsystems, components and resources do we introduce? what would be inputs and outputs?
ChatGPT
Absolutely, let's zoom in on #1, which involves enhancing the existing resource management systems. Here are some ideas:

Hydroponic Vats (For Food Production)
Subsystem: Hydroponic Units
Components: Growth Lights, Nutrient Dispensers
Resources Introduced: Nutrients
Inputs: Nutrients, Water, Energy
Outputs: Food
Description: Hydroponic vats are used to grow food rapidly in a controlled environment. They require nutrients, water, and energy to function efficiently.
Water Recyclers (For Water Purification and Recycling)
Subsystem: Water Filtration Units
Components: Filters, Pumps
Resources Introduced: None (Uses existing resource: Waste Water)
Inputs: Waste Water, Energy
Outputs: Water
Description: Water recyclers purify and recycle water from waste. They require waste water and energy to produce clean water.
Oxygen Generators (For Oxygen Production)
Subsystem: Air Separation Units
Components: Air Filters, Compressors
Resources Introduced: None (Uses existing resource: Air)
Inputs: Air, Energy
Outputs: Oxygen
Description: Oxygen generators separate oxygen from air to keep the internal environment breathable. They require air and energy to produce oxygen.
You can also introduce a "Generic Energy Resource" that powers all these systems if you haven't already, which could be generated from a power plant system in the future iterations.

For now, the outputs of these systems are the resources you already manage: Food, Water, and Oxygen. New resources introduced could be "Nutrients" for the Hydroponic Vats and "Waste Water" as a by-product that goes into Water Recyclers.

Would you like to refine this further or does this align with what you were thinking?




User
ok, so we introduce nutrients, breathable air and  waste water, if I'm reading it correctly

but oxygen generators create oxygen from water, not from air? scrubbers input air and extract oxygen from CO2
ChatGPT
Ah, my apologies for the oversight. You're correct. In many sci-fi and actual space contexts, oxygen generators often use a process called electrolysis to separate water into hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen is then released into the ship's atmosphere, and the hydrogen can be stored for other purposes or expelled as waste. Let's correct that.

Oxygen Generators (For Oxygen Production)
Subsystem: Electrolysis Units
Components: Electrolysis Cells, Pumps
Resources Introduced: None (Uses existing resource: Water)
Inputs: Water, Energy
Outputs: Oxygen, Hydrogen
Description: Oxygen generators separate water into hydrogen and oxygen through the process of electrolysis. They require water and energy to produce oxygen.
CO2 Scrubbers (For Oxygen Recovery)
Subsystem: CO2 Scrubbing Units
Components: Scrubbing Filters, Air Pumps
Resources Introduced: Breathable Air, CO2
Inputs: Breathable Air, Energy
Outputs: Oxygen, Waste CO2
Description: CO2 Scrubbers extract oxygen from CO2 in the breathable air, releasing waste CO2. They require breathable air and energy.
In this revised version:

Oxygen Generators are using water as an input to create oxygen (and hydrogen as a by-product).
CO2 Scrubbers are introduced, which consume breathable air and energy to output oxygen and waste CO2.
And yes, as you've interpreted, we would introduce new resources like Nutrients, Breathable Air, and Waste Water. Would you like to proceed with this framework?




User
so we also introduce hydrogen

let's skip scrubbers for now, we already have oxygen generators. but once we do introduce them, they might output air (less than they take in) and Carbon, too? 
ChatGPT
Yes, introducing hydrogen as a by-product makes sense if you're going to be using electrolysis in your Oxygen Generators. This could potentially set the stage for more advanced mechanics like hydrogen fuel cells or even water production later down the line.

As for the CO2 Scrubbers, you're correct. If we were to introduce them later, they could potentially take in "Breathable Air" and output not just oxygen but also a reduced amount of "Breathable Air" (since they've removed some CO2) and Carbon or "Waste CO2". Carbon could then become another resource with its own uses or disposal needs.

So if we're focusing on Oxygen Generators for now, the revised mechanics would involve:

Oxygen Generators using water and energy as inputs.
Outputs would be oxygen and hydrogen.
Does this sound good for moving forward?




User
and could carbon then be used for nutrients? and how do we replenish nutrients in other star systems? still brain-storming
ChatGPT
Absolutely, the use of Carbon in producing nutrients is a creative idea and could make for an interesting loop in the game mechanics. In real-world agricultural and biotechnological processes, carbon sources are often essential for nutrient formulations.

As for replenishing nutrients in other star systems, here are some brainstorming ideas:

Resource Mining: If you're in a star system with planets or asteroids, you could introduce mechanics for mining essential minerals or elements. You could also introduce a "Mining Drone" subsystem to handle this.

Trade Routes: If there are space stations or other civilizations, setting up trade routes for acquiring nutrients could be an option. This could introduce a whole new layer of economic and diplomatic gameplay.

Synthesis Labs: Introduce a system for synthesizing nutrients using available resources. For example, you could use Carbon, Hydrogen, and perhaps some form of energy to create "Basic Nutrients."

Recycling: Introduce systems that recycle waste material back into usable resources. For instance, composting systems could recycle food waste into nutrients.

Cosmic Phenomena: For a more adventurous angle, you could stumble upon cosmic phenomena that offer temporary boosts in resources, like a nebula rich in essential minerals.

Farming: If the ship has enough space and energy, why not a small farming module? It could be a long-term way to produce nutrients using water, carbon dioxide, and light (energy).

Local Flora/Fauna: If planets are involved, perhaps missions could be sent to collect nutrient-rich plants or other organic materials to convert back into "ship-grade" nutrients.

Research and Tech Trees: A tech tree could allow players to research more efficient ways to produce or synthesize nutrients as they progress through the game.

Piracy or Salvage: Less ethical, but looting defeated ships or unclaimed wrecks could be a source of nutrients and other resources.

So the game could offer multiple paths to solve the nutrient problem based on player choice and style of play.




User
let's zoom in on carbon and hydrogen method for a moment - does it exist, at least in SF? or something similar?
ChatGPT
The concept of synthesizing nutrients from basic elements like carbon and hydrogen is a staple of science fiction, although it is a bit of a stretch from what is currently scientifically feasible. Such processes often fall under the umbrella of "matter replication" or "molecular assemblers" in SF literature and films. The Star Trek "replicators" are a well-known example, where energy and basic matter can be transformed into food, spare parts, and virtually anything else.

In a more scientifically grounded approach, you'd typically need more than just carbon and hydrogen to create complex organic molecules like nutrients. You'd also require nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and various trace elements, not to mention the incredibly complex biochemical processes involved.

However, there are concepts like hydroponics and aeroponics, which use nutrient-rich solutions to grow plants in an environment where soil is absent. These solutions could theoretically be synthesized from basic elements given sufficient technological advancement.

There's also ongoing research into lab-grown food, where stem cells are used to grow meat without raising animals. Similarly, microbial fermentation processes are being looked into for synthesizing edible and nutritious substances. However, these processes are not as simple as combining two elements; they often require specific conditions, catalysts, and precursor compounds.

In the context of your game, you could introduce a "Nutrient Synthesizer" subsystem that combines carbon, hydrogen, and other elements (either abstracted away or specifically named) to produce "Basic Nutrients" or "Complex Nutrients" based on the technology level or available resources. This would give players another layer of resource management to consider and would make for interesting choices and trade-offs.




User
so nutrients could be synthesized from carbon, water and "minerals", let's say?
ChatGPT
Yes, that's a simplified but reasonable way to approach it for the sake of gameplay. By abstracting complex chemical processes into a more straightforward resource management system, you can keep the game fun while introducing interesting logistical challenges.

In this context, the "Nutrient Synthesizer" could consume Carbon, Water, and "Minerals" to produce "Nutrients". Here's how it could work:

Carbon: Required as the foundational element for most organic molecules.
Water (H₂O): Supplies both hydrogen and oxygen, essential for many biochemical processes.
Minerals: A catch-all term for essential micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, etc., that are needed for plant growth and other processes.
This way, you introduce new challenges related to sourcing these raw materials, as well as the management of the synthesizers themselves. It would add new layers of complexity to your game and could serve as a stepping stone for introducing even more advanced systems later on.




User
would hydrogen or water be a better fit here?
ChatGPT
Both hydrogen and water could potentially be used, but they fit different gameplay dynamics and scientific contexts:

Using Hydrogen
Scientific Context: Pure hydrogen is less commonly found in biological systems compared to water. However, hydrogen can be a key resource in various chemical reactions.
Gameplay: Using hydrogen could add an extra layer of complexity, as players would have to manage the production or acquisition of hydrogen separately from water. Hydrogen could be used in other processes as well, such as fuel for certain types of engines or reactors.
Using Water
Scientific Context: Water is a vital solvent in almost all known forms of life and is commonly used in various biological and chemical reactions. It's composed of hydrogen and oxygen, both essential elements.
Gameplay: Water is more intuitive and simpler to manage. Players can more easily relate to the concept of water being used in life-sustaining systems. Plus, water is already a resource in your game.
Summary
Hydrogen: Adds more complexity and may be less intuitive for general audiences but could open doors for advanced gameplay elements.
Water: Simpler, more intuitive, and could be seen as a more "realistic" or relatable resource for creating nutrients.
You could choose based on the level of complexity and scientific accuracy you want to introduce to the game.




User
and what would lab-grown food require, if we decide on two parallel systems (vats and lab-somethings)
ChatGPT
Lab-grown food and vat systems could potentially function as parallel systems within your game, each with their own advantages and drawbacks. Here's a possible breakdown:

Vats (Hydroponic Vats)
Resources Needed: Nutrients, Water, Light (Energy)
Outputs: Food, Oxygen (if plants are involved)
Advantages:
Could be more energy-efficient.
Could produce oxygen as a byproduct if photosynthetic plants are used.
May require fewer specialized components.
Drawbacks:
Limited types of food can be produced.
Dependent on the stability of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).
Lab-Grown Food (Cultured Meat Labs)
Resources Needed: Nutrient-rich medium (which could require a variety of nutrients), Water, Energy
Outputs: Lab-grown meat (or other cultured foods)
Advantages:
Can produce a variety of types of food (meat, fish, etc.) without the need for raising livestock or fishing.
More controlled environment; less susceptible to diseases and pests.
Drawbacks:
Could be more energy-intensive.
May require specialized components and a more complex supply chain (e.g., specific types of nutrients).
By offering two parallel systems, you could create interesting gameplay dynamics. For instance, players might start with hydroponic vats due to their simplicity and lower energy requirements but could transition to lab-grown food for greater variety and to overcome certain challenges (e.g., lack of arable land, ethical concerns about livestock, etc.).

This would add another layer of complexity and strategy to resource management and could potentially introduce some ethical or storyline elements (e.g., a faction that strongly believes in natural farming vs. another that is pushing the boundaries of biotechnology).




User
ok, we can store this idea for later, but let's give it a name to wrap it up - are there names in SF for such machines / labs / foods?
ChatGPT
Certainly! Science fiction has a rich history of creative terminology for futuristic technologies, including food production. Here are some names you might consider for your game:

Hydroponic Vats
"PhytoPods": A play on the word 'phyto,' which relates to plants.
"AgroVats": Incorporates 'agriculture' into the name.
"GreenMachines": An easy-to-understand name that emphasizes the plant-based nature of the system.
Lab-Grown Food (Cultured Meat Labs)
"SynthoMeat Labs": Emphasizes that the meat is synthesized rather than naturally grown.
"CulturaVats": A play on 'culture,' as the meat is cultured from cells.
"BioForge": Suggests a more industrialized form of biotechnology.
General or Branded Names for Food
"FutureFeast": Could be a brand name for foods produced by either system.
"NutraLoaf": A generic term for food products that come out of these systems.
"StarBite": A catchy name emphasizing that the food is designed for space travel.
These names can add a bit of flavor (pun intended) to your game while also making the mechanics more relatable and engaging.




User
ok, so it's SynthoMeat Labs then. For later, mind you

now, let's go system by system

for vats, system would be "Food production" and subsystem "Hydroponic Vats". Lights , boxes themselves (or however they are called) and nutrient dispensers might be sub- components of the main component "AgroVat 2400" or something

what I'm trying to distinguish is how to go about this if our ruleset is that systems/subsystems are only containers, while components themselves consume and produce stuff - please comment
ChatGPT
You're establishing an interesting framework for resource management within your game. In the context you've provided, where systems/subsystems are merely organizational categories and components actually perform actions, you might model it this way:

System: Food Production
Subsystem: Hydroponic Vats
Components:
AgroVat 2400
Sub-components:
UV Lights: Consumes energy, necessary for plant growth.
Planting Boxes: Holds the plants; doesn't consume or produce resources but might affect efficiency.
Nutrient Dispensers: Consumes "Nutrients," necessary for plant growth.
In this model:

UV Lights: They would consume electrical energy. Without energy, the plant growth process may stop or slow down.

Planting Boxes: These could act as a limiting factor on how many plants you can grow. The better the box, the more efficiently the plants grow, perhaps. However, as per your ruleset, they don't consume or produce resources. They may serve to limit or boost the capacity of the "AgroVat 2400".

Nutrient Dispensers: These would consume nutrient resources to boost the growth rate of plants, which are then harvested to produce food.

Each component has its own set of requirements and outputs, and they together form the subsystem that contributes to the larger system. Their combined performance could be summed up in the higher-level descriptions of the subsystem and system to which they belong.

In practical terms, the AgroVat 2400 could have a total performance metric that depends on whether all of these sub-components are functioning. For example, if you run out of nutrients, your hydroponic vats might still function but at a reduced efficiency.

Does this setup align with how you were envisioning the systems and components to work?




User
what I'm trying to compare in my head is whether A) AgroVat2400 is a component that consumes/produces all of that but is manufactured out of lights, boxes and dispensers per existing blueprint or B) AgroVat2400 is whatever we put into it (with some rules) and then sub-components themselves do stuff

pls help,  having game-design in mind
ChatGPT
Certainly, the design decision between Option A and Option B could have different implications for gameplay mechanics, player engagement, and complexity. Here's a breakdown:

Option A: Pre-defined AgroVat2400
In this option, the AgroVat2400 is a pre-packaged unit that includes UV Lights, Planting Boxes, and Nutrient Dispensers. It comes as a single component that you can just "plug and play" into your subsystem.

Pros:
Simplicity: Easier for players to understand; you just buy or build an AgroVat2400 and slot it in.
Ease of Balance: Easier for you to balance resource consumption and production rates because you control the component configurations.
Quick Progression: Players can quickly upgrade their systems by swapping out older components for newer ones.
Cons:
Lack of Customization: Players don't get to tinker with the individual parts.
Lower Complexity: Some players enjoy fine-tuning and might miss the ability to do so.
Option B: Customizable AgroVat2400
In this version, the AgroVat2400 is an empty chassis into which players can slot their own choice of UV Lights, Planting Boxes, and Nutrient Dispensers. The behavior of the unit depends on what's been added to it.

Pros:
High Customization: Players can fine-tune their setups for specific goals, adding depth to gameplay.
Engagement: The need to manage individual components could make players more invested in the well-being of their ship/station.
Dynamic Gameplay: Different challenges could require different configurations, adding an element of strategy.
Cons:
Complexity: More challenging for new players or those who prefer simpler gameplay.
Balancing: Harder for you as a designer to ensure all possible configurations are balanced.
Game Design Thoughts:
Narrative: Option B could lend itself well to a narrative where players are pioneers or survivors and have to make do with what they have.
Play Styles: Option A may attract casual gamers, while Option B could attract players who enjoy simulation and management games.
Learning Curve: Option B may require additional tutorials or hints to help players understand how to optimize their systems.
Depending on your target audience and your vision for the game, either approach could be valid.




User
you haven't included implementation complexity into pros/cons, for example if AV2400 is just an empty chassis, then we need to implement rules for each of such (because no component by itself produces food, for example)
ChatGPT
You're correct, the complexity of implementation is a crucial factor to consider, especially for a small team or a solo developer. Here's how that could look for both options:

Implementation Complexity for Option A: Pre-defined AgroVat2400
Lower Complexity: Once you define the attributes and behaviors of the AgroVat2400, implementing it is a one-time affair. It's a self-contained unit.

Rule Consistency: Since it's a fixed entity, rules related to it will be easier to manage and test.

Modularity: You can easily add more types of AgroVats later with different characteristics, by simply creating new predefined units.

Implementation Complexity for Option B: Customizable AgroVat2400
Higher Complexity: You'll need to develop a system for players to add or remove components to the chassis. Each combination may result in different behaviors, requiring more complex rules.

Dynamic Rules: Since the chassis is customizable, you'll need dynamic rules that can adapt based on what components are included. For example, if there are no UV lights, no food will be produced.

Testing: More extensive testing will be needed to cover the numerous combinations of components and to ensure they are balanced and bug-free.

UI/UX: A more complex UI may be required to enable players to customize their AgroVat, which can take time to design and implement effectively.

So, while Option B offers more depth and customization, it will likely take more time and effort to implement. Option A is simpler but may not provide the deep, engaging experience that some players look for. Your decision might be influenced by your resources and the timeline you have in mind for the project.




User
we could go with option A, but let the player tinker with blueprints. then, if we need any rules, they could be applied in single place (blueprint designer) but once a blueprint is designed, its inputs and outputs are fixed

what do you think?
ChatGPT
I think that's a very good compromise that combines the best of both worlds. The "Blueprint Designer" concept allows for player customization and depth, while keeping the complexity manageable. Here's how it could benefit the game:

Advantages:
Player Engagement: Designing blueprints offers a layer of strategy and customization, which can be rewarding and engaging for the player.

Ease of Implementation: You only need to build one "Blueprint Designer" system where all the customization rules are handled. Once the blueprint is created, it functions as a fixed entity, making it easier to manage within the game world.

Resource Management: This approach still maintains the resource management and logistics focus of the game. Players would need to secure the resources required to build according to their blueprints.

Expandability: New components and rules can be easily added to the Blueprint Designer as the game evolves, without having to rework existing systems.

Single Point of Testing: You would primarily need to ensure that the Blueprint Designer works well and generates balanced results. Once that is confirmed, you can be reasonably certain that the designed blueprints will also be balanced.

Built-in Difficulty Curve: As players progress and unlock new components, they can revisit the Blueprint Designer to create more advanced, efficient, or specialized systems, adding a natural sense of progression.

Considerations:
UI Complexity: The Blueprint Designer would require a well-designed UI to handle potentially complex interactions in an intuitive way.

Learning Curve: The concept of designing blueprints might add a learning curve, which could be mitigated with tutorials or progressive unlocking of features.

Balance: The Blueprint Designer will need a way to ensure that created systems are balanced in terms of game mechanics. This might involve some sort of "points" system or limitations on how many or what types of components can be included in a single blueprint.

Validation: There would have to be a system in place to validate that a blueprint is functional (e.g., you can't design a hydroponic system without water or light).

In summary, this approach offers a lot of flexibility and depth, with a more focused area for rule implementation and testing. It sounds like a strong fit for your game's focus on resource management and logistics.




User
ok, we can add AgroVats2400 (or however we call it) as component, it consumes energy, water and nutrients and produces food, meaning we introduce nutrients as a resource

before jumping into implementation, let's discuss the rest (recycler, o2 generator) just to confirm the approach
ChatGPT
Absolutely, let's outline the other systems briefly to ensure consistency in our approach:

Water Recycler
System: Water Management
Subsystem: Water Recycling
Component: AquaRecycler 5000
Inputs: Waste water, Energy
Outputs: Water
Oxygen Generator
System: Air Management
Subsystem: Oxygen Generation
Component: OxyGen Module Z3
Inputs: Water, Energy
Outputs: Oxygen, Hydrogen
Nutrient Synthesizer (Future Consideration)
System: Nutrient Management
Subsystem: Nutrient Synthesis
Component: NutriSynth Q1
Inputs: Carbon, Water, "Minerals", Energy
Outputs: Nutrients
Notes:
Water Recycler will allow us to introduce "Waste water" as a resource. This is important to maintain a closed-loop system and offers another dimension to resource management.

Oxygen Generator splits water into oxygen and hydrogen. This would introduce "Hydrogen" as a resource, which might be used in future systems.

Nutrient Synthesizer is more of a future consideration but would allow us to eventually bring in the components like "Carbon" and "Minerals" for more complex resource management.

Does this lineup sound reasonable? Would you like to make any adjustments before diving into implementation details?




User
oh, and power plant too pls
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's how the Power Plant could look:

Power Plant
System: Energy Management
Subsystem: Power Generation
Component: FusionCore X2
Inputs: Fuel, Cooling Water
Outputs: Energy
Notes:
FusionCore X2 is just a placeholder name; feel free to replace it with anything more fitting for your game world.

Introducing "Fuel" as a resource can offer an additional layer of complexity to the resource management system. Whether "Fuel" is mined, synthesized, or procured in some other way would add more options for gameplay.

"Cooling Water" is another interesting resource that would add depth to the game's mechanics. It could either be looped back into the system after cooling or turned into "Waste water," depending on how complex you want to make the system.

Does this outline look good? Any adjustments you'd like to see?




User
it's looking good. let's just call cooling water "water", and turn it into waste water (as output)

pls repeat the components, with just system, subsystem, inputs, outputs, and short *description* (we forgot about that one, but might be needed in reference)
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a summarized list of the components with their system, subsystem, inputs, outputs, and a short description.

AgroVats2400
System: Food Production
Subsystem: Hydroponic Vats
Inputs: Energy, Water, Nutrients
Outputs: Food
Description: The AgroVats2400 is a state-of-the-art hydroponic farming system designed for efficient, automated food production in space.

Subsystem: Power Generation
Inputs: Fuel, Water
Outputs: Energy, Waste Water
Description: The FusionCore X2 is a cutting-edge fusion reactor designed for reliable, high-output energy production. It utilizes fuel and water to generate a significant amount of energy.
Is this the format and level of detail you had in mind? Would you like to make any changes?




User
perfect, let's make few adjustments:
- let's add breathable air as resource, and just call it Air
- call Fuel instead: Fuel cells
- make more interesting  real-sounding names for systems and subsystems but only where possible (sticking to navy and/or SF) 
- make descriptions concise but give flavor to player how components work (e.g. uses electrolysis to split oxygen from water)
ChatGPT
Absolutely, here are the adjusted components with their system, subsystem, inputs, outputs, and revamped descriptions:

AgroGenesis 9000
System: Galley and Provisions
Subsystem: Astro-Farms
Inputs: Energy, Water, Nutrients
Outputs: Food
Description: The AgroGenesis 9000 employs cutting-edge hydroponics to cultivate food in a closed-loop system, minimizing waste and maximizing yield.
AquaPurifier Mk IV

Description: The FusionMaster Alpha is a high-efficiency fusion reactor. Utilizing fuel cells and a water-cooling system, it generates a constant and reliable flow of energy for the ship's operations.
How does this look? Would you like further tweaks?




User
it seems we lack one system - oxygen we have in stores and also can produce, but there should be one system in between that mixes it into breathable air?
ChatGPT
Ah, good catch! We can introduce an intermediary system that handles the mixing of pure oxygen with other gases to create breathable air. Here's how it could look:

AeroMixer 5000
System: Life Support Systems
Subsystem: Air Circulation Unit
Inputs: Oxygen, Trace Gases (Nitrogen, Argon, etc.)
Outputs: Air
Description: The AeroMixer 5000 takes pure oxygen and combines it with trace gases to produce a breathable air mixture, carefully regulated to sustain human life in confined spaces.
This system can take the oxygen generated by the OxyGenius S-2, combine it with trace gases (which could be another resource or assumed to be abundant for simplicity), and produce breathable air for the ship's environment.
