so, we already have Food, Water and Oxygen

let's see how each of these could be consumed or produced, before we introduce new ones 

For example:

Food is eaten, but can be grown in e.g. Hydroponics or something. 100% operational hydroponics should produce more than enough food (since its capacity is designed in with that in mind), but it consumes itself water, energy and nutrients (?) so at some point we would like to slow it down. Meaning it  could be operating under 100% for two reasons - either intentionally (since we have enough buffer) or due to malfunction or similar. Also, in emergency, rations can be reduced for some time before having adverse health effects.

Water can be rationed more easily, but again with some consequences after prolonged time. Yet, water on spaceship should be constantly recycled with high efficiency. Percentage would depend on whether system is running fine or is not at 100%. Could food be recycled from e.g. waste btw?

Oxygen I'm not sure about. If we exhale CO2 then it also might be recycled somehow?

Above random thoughts are identifying avenues we could explore (and then use them or not), but also identifying equipment on the ship etc

Pls jump right in :)

Certainly! The topics you've covered give us a lot of exciting avenues to explore. Here's a more structured breakdown based on your thoughts:

Food
Production:
Food can be produced in hydroponics facilities.
Hydroponics could have a capacity range: 0% to 100% operational.
Consumption:
Standard daily rations for crew.
Resource Dependencies for Production:
Consumes water, energy, and potentially nutrients.
Failure Modes:
Drought, disease, or nutrient deficiency could reduce hydroponics to below 100% operational capacity.
Emergency Measures:
Rations can be reduced for a short time before causing health effects.
Water
Production:
Produced mainly through recycling systems.
Water purification facilities.
Consumption:
Drunk by crew, used in hydroponics and other industrial processes.
Resource Dependencies for Production:
Requires energy for purification and recycling.
Failure Modes:
Contamination, machinery malfunction could reduce purification rates.
Emergency Measures:
Water can be rationed more easily but with long-term consequences.
Possibly derived from waste or other biological processes (though this would require advanced technology).
Oxygen
Production:
Produced through life support systems that split water into oxygen and hydrogen.
Could have scrubbers that recycle CO2 back into oxygen.
Consumption:
Consumed by crew and possibly by certain manufacturing processes.
Resource Dependencies for Production:
Requires energy, and potentially water if using electrolysis.
Failure Modes:
Malfunction in life support systems, leakage, or sabotage.
Emergency Measures:
Oxygen supply can be rationed to an extent, but this has immediate health risks.
Each of these subsystems for Food, Water, and Oxygen can operate at variable efficiency, providing opportunities for player decision-making. The ship's "health" could be determined by how well these basic needs are being met. Additionally, the dependencies between these systems (e.g., water is needed for hydroponics, which produces food) create complex interrelationships that the player needs to manage.


Your ideas align well with realistic spacecraft systems, and they're good candidates for gameplay mechanics. Let's break down each one:

Energy
Power Plant: Fuel cells are a good choice for a primary power source. For a game, you could simplify it to just 'hydrogen fuel cells' without getting into the technicalities of the various kinds (like PEM, SOFC, etc.).

Solar Power: Realistically, solar power is more effective closer to a star and less effective as you move away. You could use this concept to add an extra layer of complexity. When not under acceleration, as you mentioned, you could deploy more solar panels to boost power generation.

Batteries: Perfect for storing excess energy and for use during peak loads or emergencies. Could be a finite resource that needs recharging.

Water
Water Recycling: A 1% loss per month when at peak efficiency is reasonable for a game mechanic. This could fluctuate depending on system health and efficiency.

Water Tanks: Starting with a set amount makes sense, and gameplay could involve trying to keep this topped up.

Food
Hydroponics: Water and energy are the key inputs. In a simple game, you probably don't need to worry about nutrients or specific lighting conditions for different crops.

Emergency Rations: Finite resource, only used when absolutely necessary. Could come with morale penalties if used for extended periods.

Fresh Produce: The result of successful hydroponics. Could come with a morale boost when available.

Oxygen
Oxygen Tanks: A finite resource that starts at a specific level and needs to be conserved.

Oxygen Generators: These could use water and energy to separate oxygen from hydrogen, topping up the oxygen levels.

CO2 Scrubbers: Use some energy but recover a fraction of the used oxygen, thus being essential for long-term survival.

Your concepts are good starting points for game mechanics. Depending on your gameplay goals, you could introduce more complexity later, like system malfunctions, resource trade-offs, or morale effects from rationing and life support quality.

Would you like to focus on any of these mechanics in particular for your next development iteration?

I would like to keep it simple for now, like food is just "Food" and quantity is just "100".  

ok, so we add something like this:
- energy stored
- power plants
- hydroponic vats
- water recyclers
- oxygen generators
- each tick each system that is used consumes resources
- crew is also a "system" and consumes resources (should simplify things I think)
- all machines are "in numbers" so efficiency is represented as 5/7 machines working (this should simplify things, I think)
- we split UI in two tabs: "Supplies and Cargo" and "Ship systems"

maybe we start by adding energy as resource and crew as a system, and go from there, adding one system at a time

what do you think?

Your plan sounds like a well-thought-out expansion of the current game mechanics, and I like the idea of adding the features incrementally. Here's how you might go about it:

Energy Stored: Add this as a new resource, similar to how you've managed food, water, and oxygen.

Crew as a System: Introduce the crew as a system that consumes resources. This will help you set the ground for other systems that also consume resources. This could consume food, water, and oxygen (and later on energy).

Add UI Tabs: Create the "Supplies and Cargo" and "Ship Systems" tabs in the UI. Initially, the "Supplies and Cargo" tab can list your resources (food, water, oxygen, energy), and "Ship Systems" can list the efficiency and status of different systems, starting with the crew.

Power Plants: Add power plants as a system that produces energy. It would consume some resource (like fuel, if you introduce it later on) to generate energy.

Hydroponic Vats, Water Recyclers, Oxygen Generators: Add each of these systems one by one, making sure to update the mechanics and the UI each time to reflect their efficiencies and resource consumptions.

Resource Consumption per Tick: Update your game loop to account for the consumption and production of resources based on the efficiencies and numbers of each system.

Efficiency in Numbers: I like your idea of representing efficiency as a fraction (like 5/7 machines working). This makes it easier to understand and could add a strategic element to the game.
